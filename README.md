Retired Major League Baseball players can be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame if they played for at least ten seasons in the major leagues. 

At least five years must pass between their last season and the time of their election. 

Nominees must receive at least 75% of votes from members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, which is why only three players were inducted this year.  

A player’s name can remain on the ballot for 10 years. 

Votes are based on players’ record, ability, character, sportsmanship and contributions to their team(s).  

The Hall of Fame is located in Cooperstown, New York.
